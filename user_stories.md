As a marketing research team, I want:
- A clean layout and minimalistic visual design to the app so the research participant isn't distracted by other objects on the page and focuses only on the product images presented.
- The results to be optionally shown with a click of a button only after a total of 14 (14 images total) selections have been made.
- Results to be displayed graphically in a chart or table to the research participant in a meaningful way that both the participant and market researcher would understand.
- The research participant to respond honestly and not race through clicking on the images just to finish the task.  There needs to  be a perceived benefit to the participant/future customer.

As a developer,  I want:
- to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate duplication in my JavaScript.
- to use object oriented programming to build this app so that the app will be more effective and code will be easier to read and understand.
- the images that are displayed on the page to have the same dimensions, aspect ratio, and to be cropped in a way that maintains the essence of the product.
- to not have multiples of the same image displayed on the page at the same time.  
- to keep track of the number of clicks each image receives in the image's object and use event handling to record the participant's clicks on an image.
- to design the app with a readable custom font and color palette that is neutral.
- to have a button that populates the random images on the screen. There should be no images on the screen until after the participant has read the instructions.  
- to display data in a table to the market research team so they have all the data available to make a proper decision on which products to eventually sell.

As an individual research participant, I want:
- Clear and concise instructions on exactly what it is I'm supposed to do.
- I want to be given the option to be able to see my results/not see my results after I've made my selections.
- My task to be as straightforward and basic as possible.  I don't want to have to spend a lot of time learning how to use the app.
- To be rewarded for participating in this market research since my time is valuable.
- An easy to use UI.
